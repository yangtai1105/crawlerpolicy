## Summary

Anthropic announced that effective October 30, 2026, it began recognizing a machine-readable signal enabling website owners to opt out of AI model training. The implementation follows draft specifications developed by the IETF aipref working group and is rolling out globally across Anthropic services. The company also established that specific ClaudeBot directives in robots.txt will supersede general training preference signals.

## Key facts

- As of October 30, 2026, Anthropic began recognizing a machine-readable signal enabling website owners to express preferences regarding AI model training usage.
- Anthropic is rolling out recognition of the new signal globally across all services over time.
- The preference signal is based on draft specifications from the IETF aipref working group.
- Specific ClaudeBot directives in robots.txt take priority over general machine-readable preference settings for any given path.
- If a site's robots.txt does not mention ClaudeBot, Anthropic applies the general training preference setting.
- Anthropic added guidance clarifying that Anthropic-hosted task browsers operating for users, including Claude Duet (Claude-Agent), are documented separately from standard robots.

## Insight

By implementing IETF aipref draft signals alongside robots.txt, Anthropic bridges broad protocol-level AI training preferences with bot-specific crawler directives, establishing explicit conflict-resolution rules where specific user-agent blocks override general opt-outs.

## Implication

Web publishers seeking to restrict model training can now rely on emerging standardized aipref metadata without needing to configure every individual proprietary crawler, while still retaining granular overrides via ClaudeBot rules.

## Why it matters

Anthropic becomes one of the earliest frontier AI labs to officially support the IETF aipref standard for AI training opt-outs, validating standard-setting efforts to separate general data-use permissions from transport-level crawling blocks.

+Block or limit Anthropic’s bots
 As per industry standard, Anthropic uses a variety of robots to gather data from the public web for model development, to search the web, and to retrieve web content at users’ direction. Anthropic uses different robots to enable website owner transparency and choice. Below is information on the three robots that Anthropic uses and how to set your site preferences to enable those you want to access your content and limit those you don’t.

 Opting out of being crawled by Anthropic Bots requires modifying the robots.txt file in the manner above. Alternate methods like blocking IP address(es) from which Anthropic Bots operates may not work correctly or persistently guarantee an opt-out, as doing so impedes our ability to read your robots.txt file. If a crawler has a source IP address on
 this list
 , it indicates that the crawler is coming from Anthropic.

+How Anthropic honors website preferences for AI training
+As of October 30, 2026, Anthropic has begun recognizing a machine-readable signal that lets website owners express a preference about whether their content may be used to train AI models.
+This announcement is a continued commitment to respecting robot.txt where ClaudeBot is explicitly named. We’re now confirming that we will honor a new preference signal that lets website owners say “no AI training”.
+We’re rolling this out across all of our services over time and globally, and will provide updates on our progress.
+The signal follows
+a draft based on work done by the IETF
+, the group that sets many of the internet’s technical standards, in its aipref working group. Because standards in this space are still evolving, the way we read and apply these settings may change too.
+How ClaudeBot rules take priority
+ClaudeBot is our training crawler, and we treat rules that name it directly as more specific than the general signal. In practice, for a given path:
+If your robots.txt file names ClaudeBot
+, we follow that rule, even if your general setting says something different.
+If your robots.txt file doesn’t mention ClaudeBot
+, we follow the general setting described above.
